            <p> Hi, I'm

            Lance Putnam. 

            I'm a creator, dreamer and hacker-to-be.

            I am a graduate of Presbyterian College and the Clemson MBA in Entrepreneurship program. Currently, I am enrolled as a front-end engineering candidate in The Iron Yard Academy in Greenville, South Carolina. I started at The Iron Yard to hone in on a skill that I have long admired, and one that I became familiar with during my entrepreneurial studies. My passion for startups and innovation has made the coding skill set the perfect choice for me. 

            Along with being a future hacker, I am a painter, screen printer, travel buff, documentary junkie and grilled cheese connoisseur.  I like also like to tweet on Twitter, share photos of my adventures on Instagram and blog about my journey as a coder.
